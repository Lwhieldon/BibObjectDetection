During the cropping process, a text file containing the image names of the cropped bib files along their true RBN will be created.  A similar list will also be created for the predicted RBNs during the digit detection step.  These lists can then be compared in the validation section. \n","\n","Set1 and Set2 of the RBNR dataset will be used to train the bib detection model. Note also that Set1 & Set2 have not been used in training the digit detection model yet so all three sets are being used as validation for this step to see how effective the model solely training on SVHN data performs when applying this to the RBNR datasets.\n","\n","### Credits\n","\n","This notebook is an adaptation of the notebook provided by Roboflow located [here](https://blog.roboflow.com/train-yolov4-tiny-on-custom-data-lighting-fast-detection/) and Eric Bayless' implementation [here](https://github.com/ericBayless/bib-detector).  Thank you Roboflow & Eric!!\n","\n","### Details:\n","The annotations for the RBNR dataset are provided as Matlab formatted files named `<image name>.mat`.  There is one file for each image.  A description of the format can be found in the `readme.txt` located in each set folder.  In this project, I will be using Darknet to train custom Yolo models with this dataset, and Darknet requires annotations to be in the Darknet TXT format.  \n","\n","More information about Darknet annotation format can be found [here](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet#how-to-train-to-detect-your-custom-objects)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"l12vq6XfZqgr"},"source":["## Grabbing Content \n","---\n","Pulling repos, data, and organizing directories to prep for YOLOv4 training.\n","\n","***IMPORTANT!!*** Colab does not have the latest opencv-python library installed (as of April 2022); therefore, make sure to upgrade the opencv-python so that you can run the detections.
